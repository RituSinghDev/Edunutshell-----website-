LOGO SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
========================

Please replace the placeholder logo file with your actual logo:

1. Copy your logo file (edunutshellsidelogo.png) from the parent directory
2. Paste it here in the public folder
3. Make sure it's named: edunutshellsidelogo.png

The logo is used in:
- Navigation bar (components/Navbar.tsx)
- Footer (components/Footer.tsx)

Recommended logo specifications:
- Format: PNG with transparent background
- Dimensions: 180x60 pixels (or similar aspect ratio)
- File size: Under 100KB for optimal performance

If you have other logo files (Group 12.svg, Group 12.png, Group 7.png), 
you can also add them here and update the component references as needed.
